
I am 20 years old, and I am a cybersecurity student at Bandırma Onyedi Eylül University. I know HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, and SQL. I can use Kali Linux and other Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and macOS. I have completed my first year and I am now in my second year, feeling very motivated in my field. I am able to do CTF challenges. That's all for now; I hope to improve myself even more in the future.
